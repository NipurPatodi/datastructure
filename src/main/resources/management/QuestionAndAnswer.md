When interviewing for a management position,\ 
it is important to present yourself as a candidate who works well with others, \
values the company culture and delegates work appropriately. If you are asked to speak about an experience, \
remember to use the STAR technique:

**Situation**: Briefly explain an issue you were dealing with in a positive, constructive way.\
**Task**: Describe your role in the situation.\
**Action**: Detail what you did to resolve or address the problem.\
**Result**: Explain what you learned and how your actions led to positive results for your workplace.

### 1. Tell me about a time you had to manage a difficult employee. ###
1. Situation- In my last role, One of my junior team member was consistently missing deadline which could possibly prevent us from reaching our sprint goals.\
2. Task- I being manage tried schedule meeting with him in order to get his perspective on his work performance.
3. Action - I learned that he was struggling with design issues and was hesitant to ask it to seniors.
   I appreciate extra effort he had put but on same time help him understand power of team work.
   I mentored his for that instance and made him comfortable with other seniors in the team.
   I also arranged training session with other exp. members of team
    
5. Result -  As a result, he quickly increased his workflow and felt more comfortable proactively asking for help.

### 2. How do you measure success ? ###
- Set attained able goal
- Create large goal for team
    - create small milestones
    - celebrating each mile stones
    
e.g. We had urgent business ask to make one capability quickly to market. \
I worked closely with team and splitted ask into workable stories paying attention to all possible road blockers \
- Worked closely with TPMS , PM and business to get detailed documents and proper Data set for team to progress
- Set up daily update >15 mins and biweekly demo per story
- Had weekly meeting to get pulse of any blocker
- We finished campaign above and beyond  client standards.

### 3. How would you describe your management style? ###
- Trust my team
- Enabler , clear direction and outline our overall goal
- real effort not to micromanage 
- prefer to remain handsoff but available for help, guidance and assistance
- regular informal check-in, , but I try not to make people feel like I’m breathing down their necks or forcing everyone to sacrifice valuable work time

### 4. How do you delegate responsiblity ###
- Identify members’ personal strengths first.
- Once I understand the group as a network of individuals, I can then delegate the tasks in order to build an efficient team.
-  I met with each member of my department once a month to talk about their progress, issues they may have been experiencing and any opportunities they wanted to pursue. One employee felt that her strengths were not being fully utilized. I found some more challenging responsibilities for her, and our entire department’s productivity increased as a result


### 5. How do you motivate your team? ###
- preferred regular positive reinforcement,\
- while another wanted critical feedback on her projects.

### 6. How do you handle conflict between team members? ###
There are always two sides to every story, which is why it’s so important to me to remain as neutral and open-minded as possible whenever I hear of conflict between teammates.  I was in a situation a few years ago where two members of my team were clearly unhappy with each other.  Rather than let it fester or ignoring it with the hope that they would be able to work it out themselves, I sat down with them individually and asked them to explain what was going on.  We discussed reasonable and professional solutions that worked for both parties and the matter was resolved.
