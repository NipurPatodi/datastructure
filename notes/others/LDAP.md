LDAP is a standard protocol designed to maintain and access “directory services” within a network. Think of a directory service as a phonebook for different network resources like files, printers, users, devices, and servers, etc.

For example, an organization may store information for all their printers in a directory. LDAP can enable users to search for a specific printer, locate it on the network, and securely connect to it.
