### Star technique ###
Situation: Describe a specific situation. You need to give enough information that the interviewer will be able to understand the circumstances.
Task: What was expected to do and why? What was driving force to complete it, target
Action: Describe the actions taken. You should prioritize what you did, what your contribution was, and how those things were impactful. Focus on “I," not “we”.
Result: Describe the outcome. DO NOT undercut your role in the situation, this is not the time to be modest. 
When talking about the result, make sure you go over what happened, how the event ended, what was accomplished, and what you learned. 
Be positive. Even if the outcome was unsatisfactory, it is important that something positive came from it. 
Remember, even when things are negative (or not what you had hoped) good things can still come from them. 
Oftentimes, individuals have to be prompted in this section of their answer; stand out by including this part on your own.

### Thinks to keep in mind ###
If a candidate takes too much time answering, elaborates in ways that aren’t helpful, or gives a response that isn’t related to the question, it interferes with the interviewer’s plan.
The interviewer may become concerned about `managing time or annoyed` that they aren’t getting the input they need.
> Be concise first and elaborate later if asked to say more.
> Witnesses are told to be sure they understand the question being asked, and then give the shortest truthful answer they can give.
> Don’t keep talking because you have other things that you think will make you sound good.
> “Blowing them away” with acronyms and technical lingo can backfire.
> Don’t talk over someone in the interview.  Before you resume, ask, “shall I continue?”

Avoid
---
I’m always on time → I prefer being on time whenever possible.
I’m never insensitive → I work hard to give feedback in a constructive way that considers personal feelings.
That’s everything that happened → Those are the examples I can recall right now.
