Geospatial functions, also known as geospatial operations or spatial functions, are operations and computations performed on geographical or spatial data. They involve manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data that is tied to specific geographic locations on the Earth's surface. These functions are essential in various fields such as geography, cartography, remote sensing, urban planning, environmental science, and more. Geospatial functions enable us to understand spatial relationships, patterns, and trends in the world around us.

Some common geospatial functions include:

Distance Calculation: These functions compute distances between points, lines, or polygons on the Earth's surface. Examples include calculating the distance between two coordinates using various distance metrics like Euclidean, Haversine, or Vincenty formulas.

Geometric Operations: These functions involve operations such as intersection, union, difference, and buffering on spatial objects like points, lines, and polygons. These operations are used to analyze spatial relationships and perform overlay analyses.

Spatial Queries: Spatial queries involve retrieving data based on their spatial relationships. Examples include finding all points within a certain distance of a given point or identifying all polygons that intersect a specific area.

Spatial Analysis: This involves more complex analyses that use geospatial data to derive insights. Examples include hotspot analysis, density estimation, and spatial interpolation.

Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding: Geocoding is the process of converting human-readable addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). Reverse geocoding is the opposite, where coordinates are translated into addresses.

Raster Operations: These functions work with raster data, which represents continuous surfaces as a grid of cells. Operations include resampling, reclassification, and calculations involving raster data layers.

Network Analysis: This involves finding the shortest paths or routes between locations on a network, such as roads, streets, or utility networks. It's used in applications like GPS navigation and logistics planning.

Spatial Visualization: These functions help in creating maps and visual representations of geospatial data. This includes thematic mapping, choropleth maps, heatmaps, and 3D visualization.

Geospatial Statistics: Statistical analyses are performed on spatial data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships. Geostatistical methods like kriging and spatial autocorrelation are used for this purpose.

Remote Sensing: These functions process data captured by satellites and other remote sensors to extract information about the Earth's surface. This includes land cover classification, change detection, and vegetation analysis.

These are just a few examples of the wide range of geospatial functions available. They are crucial for understanding and making informed decisions about the physical world and its geographic components. With the advancement of technology, geographic information systems (GIS) and geospatial software have become integral tools for performing these functions efficiently and accurately.


Spatial queries in Presto involve performing operations and analyses on geospatial data using SQL syntax. Presto is an open-source distributed SQL query engine designed for running interactive analytics queries on various data sources, including structured and semi-structured data. It supports geospatial functions and allows you to perform spatial queries on data stored in formats like Parquet, ORC, and more.

Here are some examples of spatial queries you can perform in Presto:

Point-in-Polygon Query:
Find all points that fall within a specific polygon.

sql
Copy code
SELECT point_data.*
FROM point_data
JOIN polygon_data
ON ST_Within(point_data.coordinates, polygon_data.polygon);
Distance Query:
Find all points within a certain distance from a given point.

sql
Copy code
SELECT point_data.*
FROM point_data
WHERE ST_Distance(point_data.coordinates, ST_Point(lon, lat)) <= radius;
Polygon Intersection Query:
Find polygons that intersect a given polygon.

sql
Copy code
SELECT polygon_data.*
FROM polygon_data
WHERE ST_Intersects(polygon_data.polygon, given_polygon);
Buffering Query:
Create a buffer around a point or polygon.

sql
Copy code
SELECT ST_Buffer(point_data.coordinates, buffer_distance) AS buffer_geom
FROM point_data;
Convex Hull Query:
Calculate the convex hull of a set of points.

sql
Copy code
SELECT ST_ConvexHull(ST_Collect(coordinates)) AS convex_hull
FROM point_data;
Aggregate Spatial Query:
Calculate the total area covered by polygons grouped by a specific attribute.

sql
Copy code
SELECT attribute, SUM(ST_Area(polygon)) AS total_area
FROM polygon_data
GROUP BY attribute;
Geocoding Query:
Convert an address into geographic coordinates.

sql
Copy code
SELECT ST_GeomFromText('POINT(' || lon || ' ' || lat || ')') AS coordinates
FROM address_data;
Reverse Geocoding Query:
Convert coordinates into an address.

sql
Copy code
SELECT ST_AsText(ST_Point(lon, lat)) AS address
FROM coordinates_data;
Please note that the above examples are for illustrative purposes and may need adjustments based on your specific data schema and requirements. Additionally, Presto's support for spatial functions may depend on the version of Presto you are using and the installed extensions. Presto can leverage spatial extensions like "geospatial" to provide these functionalities. Make sure to consult the Presto documentation and extensions documentation for accurate and up-to-date information.
