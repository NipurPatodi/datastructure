## Data Mesh ##

The data mesh is an exciting new methodology for managing data at large. The
concept foresees an architecture in which data is highly distributed and a future
in which scalability is achieved by federating responsibilities.


## Data Fabric ##
The data fabric is an approach that addresses today’s data management and
scalability challenges by adding intelligence and simplifying data access using
self-service. In contrast to the data mesh, it focuses more on the technology layer.
It’s an architectural vision using unified metadata with an end-to-end integrated
layer (fabric) for easily accessing, integrating, provisioning, and using data.
