## gRPC
gRPC is a high performance, open source RPC framework initially developed by Google. It helps to eliminate boilerplate code, and connect polyglot services in and across data centers.

A client application can directly call methods on a server application as if it was a local object.

we need three thing 
1. server (grcp-netty)
2. protobuf (grpc-protobuf)
3. stub (grpc-stub)

A stub in distributed computing is a piece of code that converts parameters passed between client and server
during a remote procedure call (RPC)
